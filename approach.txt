First Step: read in the input information. 
The standard input function in Python does not enforce a specific formatting of the input or its value.
Moreover, given the nature of the problem, all input numbers should be integers.
To account for possible mistakes in the input, eg. numbers N or M exceeding 1000, I include clauses and printed instructions to guide the user.
