COMPLEXITY
The complexity of the proposed solution is: ~O(M * N^2)  
This because for every M pizzeria, N * N operations need to be performed when calculating its distance to every city block. 
Given that M can be of the same order of N, O(1000), the proposed solution can have complexity ~O(N^3). 
This complexity can be prohibitive for very large N values.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT
Knowing that deliveries can travel a finite distance, it follows that calculating the distance between every pizzeria and every city block is superfluous 
(it's pointless to calculate the distance to block 20 away, if the pizzeria delivers only at a distance of 5 blocks!).
Moreover, the East/West and North/South contraint on the motion suggests that the delivery always forms a "star" patter on the city blocks grid, like this

  X
 XXX
XXXXX
 XXX
  X

except the "edge cases", where this pattern can be truncated due to the position of the pizzeria being close to or on the edge of the city grid.

This observation implies that, given the coordinates of a pizzeria, we readily know which are the blocks that it reaches, suppressing the need to perform repeated Manhattan distance calculations.
Moreover, the symmetry of the pattern provides a further simplication: in fact, only one quarter of the indices need to be consider, as the others are reflexions of these along both axes.

A solution like this would have a complexity at most of ~O(M * K), with K the largest reachable distance of all pizzerias.
